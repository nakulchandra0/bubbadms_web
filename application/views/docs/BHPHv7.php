You will provide coverage in the amount of the vehicle's actual cash value less a maximum deductible of $1,500. You may purchase, or provide through an existing policy, the insurance through anyone you choose who is reasonably acceptable to us. Each policy you get will provide that the insurance company will give us at least 10 days’ written notice before the policy is canceled. You must name us as the person to be paid under the policy in the event of damage or loss. If the vehicle is damaged or lost, at our option, we can use the insurance proceeds to replace or repair it or to repay any amounts you owe under this contract.</p>
                      <p> If you do not obtain and maintain the insurance required by this contract and do not continue to provide satisfactory proof of insurance, we will consider this contract in default. We may, at our option, repossess the vehicle, purchase insurance at your expense, or pursue any other remedy provided for in this contract. The insurance we purchase may either cover both our interest and your interest or our interest only. Any coverage we buy will not include insurance on liability for bodily injury or property damage, except with respect to the vehicle, and will not meet the requirement for proof of financial responsibility under Georgia law. The charges for insurance we obtain may be substantially higher than the charges you would pay if you bought the insurance you are required by this contract to have on the vehicle yourself. The charge for insurance will be the premium of the insurance. In addition, you will incur a finance charge on the amount of any insurance premiums.</p>

                      <p>_____________________________________________ Insurance Company ________________________________________ Agent  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF INSURANCE TO BE FINANCED. If we finance the insurance you are required by this contract to have against damage or loss to the vehicle, the following applies:  Name of Insurer: _________________________________________  Term of Insurance: _______________________________________  Premium: _________________   You agree that the premium for the above-described insurance will be included in the Amount Financed under this contract.   X ____________________________________________ (Buyer)   X ____________________________________________ (Co-Buyer)</p>
                      <p>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p>FINANCE CHARGE AND PAYMENTS. We will compute your Finance Charge on a daily basis at the Annual Percentage Rate on the unpaid part of the Amount Financed. We based the Finance Charge, Total of Payments and the Total Sale Price shown in this contract on the assumption that you will make each payment in the amount due and on the date due. These amounts will be more if you pay late and less if you pay early. These changes may take the form of a larger or smaller last payment or, if we choose, additional payments of the same amount as your scheduled payments with a smaller final payment. We will notify you about these changes before your final scheduled payment is due. </p>

If you breach this contract, we can accelerate your payments and demand full and immediate payment of the remaining amount due; repossess the vehicle; take any reasonable measures to correct the default, or save us from loss; or pursue any other remedy permitted by law in recovering the full remaining amount due. We do not have to give you notice before pursuing any of these remedies. You will pay the costs and expenses of these measures. </p>
                      <p>REPOSSESSION. If you are in default, we may take the vehicle from you if we may do so without a breach of the peace. We may repossess the vehicle by any means including entering your property, or the property where it is stored.

                <p>This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16. This Arbitration Agreement uses certain defined terms. A &quot;Dispute&quot; is any contract, tort, statutory or other claim or dispute between you and Seller arising out of or relating to your credit application, this contract, or any resulting transaction or relationship (including any such relationship with third parties who do not sign this Arbitration Agreement). &quot;Seller&quot; includes seller's assignee and also includes Seller's and such assignee's employees, agents, successors or assigns. &quot;Dispute&quot; includes any disagreement over the interpretation and scope of this clause, or the arbitrability of the Dispute.</p>
                <p> Any Dispute shall, at your or Seller’s request, be resolved by binding arbitration and not in court.  Arbitration will be by one arbitrator on an individual basis and not as a class action. You waive any right you may have to arbitrate a Dispute as a class action (this is referred to below as the &quot;class action waiver&quot;). Arbitration will be conducted by and under the rules of the American Arbitration Association, 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019 (www.adr.org), or any other arbitration organization you select, subject to Seller’s approval. You may get the rules of the organization by contacting it or visiting its website.</p>
                <p> Arbitrators shall be attorneys or retired judges selected pursuant to the applicable rules. The arbitrator shall apply governing substantive law in making an award. The arbitration hearing shall be conducted in the federal district in which you reside, or at some other location convenient to you, or as otherwise required by law.  Seller will pay your filing, administration, service or case management fee and your arbitrator or hearing fee all up to a maximum of $1,500, unless applicable law or the rules of the chosen arbitration organization require Seller to pay more.  Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney, expert and other fees, unless otherwise awarded by the arbitrator under applicable law. </p>
                <p>The arbitrator's award is final and binding on all parties. Any arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state arbitration law.  </p>
                <p>You and Seller retain the right to sue in small claims court for a Dispute within that court's jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. Neither you nor Seller waive the right to arbitrate by filing suit. Any court with jurisdiction may enter judgment on the arbitrator's award. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive any termination, payoff or transfer of this contract. If any part of this Arbitration Agreement, other than the class action waiver, is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason, the remainder is enforceable. If the class action waiver is deemed or found to be unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement shall be unenforceable.  </p>
                <p>This Arbitration Agreement is incorporated into and becomes a part of this contract or any other credit obligation that you enter into with Seller on the contract date shown on Page 1.  You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by doing so in writing to the Seller’s address on Page 1 of this contract, or a different address the Holder may provide you, sent by registered mail, postmarked no later than 10 days from the contract date.</p>
